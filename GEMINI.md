# CLAUDE.md - Pattern ADHD Cognitive Support System

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL WARNING**: DO NOT run `pattern-cli` or any agent commands during development!
Agents are currently running in production. Any CLI invocation will disrupt active agents.
Migrations and testing must be done offline after stopping production agents.

Pattern is a multi-agent ADHD support system inspired by MemGPT's architecture to provide external executive function through specialized cognitive agents.

## Project Status

**Current State**: Core multi-agent framework operational, expanding integrations

### üöß Current Development Priorities

1. **Backend API Server** - üü° ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT
   - Basic Axum server structure exists
   - Auth handlers partially implemented
   - Most endpoints still need implementation
   - Required for multi-user hosting

3. **MCP Client Refinement** - üü¢ NEEDS VERIFICATION
   - All transports implemented (stdio, HTTP, SSE)
   - Tool discovery and wrapper system working
   - Needs testing with real MCP servers
   - Auth support may need improvements

4. **Task Management System** - üü¢ QUEUED
   - Database schema exists
   - Need CLI commands and user-facing features
   - ADHD-aware task breakdown planned

5. **MCP Server** - üü¢ LOWER PRIORITY
   - Stub implementation only
   - Expose Pattern tools to external clients

## Completed Features

### ‚úÖ Message Batching
- Snowflake IDs for absolute ordering across all messages
- Batch tracking for atomic request/response cycles
- Tool call/response pairing maintained within batches
- Heartbeat continuations stay in same batch as original request
- Compression preserves batch boundaries (no splitting tool pairs)
- Generic heartbeat processor for all consumer crates
- Archive summaries as metadata, not fake messages
- **Migration completed** - all agent histories properly batched
- See `/home/booskie/pattern/docs/message-batching-design.md` for architecture

- Full CLI support with create/add-member/status/list commands
- All coordination patterns working (RoundRobin, Dynamic, Pipeline, Supervisor, Voting, Sleeptime)
- Discord and Bluesky integration
- Runtime message routing through patterns
- More use cases and templates to be added

### ‚úÖ Discord Integration
- Full message handling with batching and merging
- Typing indicators with auto-refresh
- Reaction handling on bot messages
- All slash commands implemented (/help, /status, /memory, /archival, /context, /search, /list)
- Group integration with coordination patterns
- Data source mode for event ingestion

### ‚úÖ MCP Client
- All three transports implemented (stdio, HTTP, SSE)
- Tool discovery and dynamic wrapper system
- Integration with Pattern's tool registry
- Mock tools for testing when no server available
- Basic auth support (Bearer tokens)

### ‚úÖ Bluesky/ATProto Integration
- Jetstream firehose consumer fully operational
- Thread context fetching with constellation API
- Memory block creation for users
- Rich text processing with mentions/links
- Reply handling and posting capabilities
- **Post batching**: Groups related posts within 3-second windows to reduce notification spam
- Thread-aware batching for conversations
- DashMap-based concurrent batch management

### ‚úÖ Data Source Framework
- Flexible trait supporting pull/push patterns
- File watching with indexing
- Discord message ingestion
- Coordinator managing multiple sources
- Prompt templates for notifications

### ‚úÖ Model Configuration
- Comprehensive model registry with July 2025 specs
- Dynamic token calculation
- Smart caching with Anthropic optimization
- Message compression strategies

## Development Principles

- **Type Safety First**: Use Rust enums over string validation
- **Pure Rust**: Avoid C dependencies to reduce build complexity
- **Test-Driven**: All tests must validate actual behavior and be able to fail
- **Entity Relationships**: Use SurrealDB RELATE for all associations, no foreign keys
- **Atomic Operations**: Database operations are non-blocking with optimistic updates

**Each crate has its own `CLAUDE.md` with specific implementation guidelines.**

## Core Architecture

### Agent Framework
- **DatabaseAgent**: Generic over ModelProvider and EmbeddingProvider
- **Built-in tools**: context, recall, search, send_message
- **Message persistence**: RELATE edges with Snowflake ID ordering
- **Memory system**: Thread-safe with semantic search, archival support, and atomic updates

### Coordination Patterns
- **Dynamic**: Selector-based routing (random, capability, load-balancing)
- **Round-robin**: Fair distribution with skip-inactive support
- **Sleeptime**: Background monitoring with intervention triggers
- **Pipeline**: Sequential processing through agent stages
- **Supervisor**: Hierarchical delegation
- **Voting**: Consensus-based decisions

### Entity System
Uses `#[derive(Entity)]` macro for SurrealDB integration:

```rust
#[derive(Entity)]
#[entity(entity_type = "user")]
pub struct User {
    pub id: UserId,
    pub username: String,

    // Relations via RELATE, not foreign keys
    #[entity(relation = "owns")]
    pub owned_agents: Vec<Agent>,
}
```

## Known Issues

### API Provider Issues
- **Anthropic Thinking Mode**: Message compression can create invalid sequences with tool calls
- **Gemini Response Structure**: Missing `/candidates/0/content/parts` path during heartbeat continuations
- **Gemini Empty Contents**: "contents is not specified" error when all messages filtered out
- **Tool call validation**: Compression sometimes leaves unpaired tool calls (affects Flux agent)
- See `docs/known-api-issues.md` for workarounds

### Export Issues
- **CAR Export**: Not archiving full message history - pattern matching issues preventing complete export
  - Related to unused `CompressionSettings` struct in `pattern_core/src/export/types.rs`
  - Lower priority but needs fixing for proper data portability

## Implementation Notes

### üîß Memory Block Pass-through
Data sources can attach memory blocks to messages for agent context:
- DataSource trait returns memory blocks with notifications
- Coordinator includes blocks in message metadata
- Bluesky creates/retrieves user profile blocks automatically
- Router needs to create RELATE edges for block attachment (TODO)

### üîß Anti-looping Protection
- Router returns errors instead of silently dropping messages
- 30-second cooldown between rapid agent-to-agent messages
- Prevents acknowledgment loops

### üîß Constellation Integration
- Thread siblings fetched from constellation.microcosm.blue
- Engagement metrics and agent interaction tracking
- Smart filtering based on agent DID and friend lists
- Rich thread context display with [YOU] markers

## Feature Development Workflow

1. **Branch Creation**: `git checkout -b feature/task-management`
2. **Implementation**: Follow crate-specific CLAUDE.md guidelines
3. **Testing**: Add tests that validate actual behavior
4. **Validation**: Run `just pre-commit-all` before commit
5. **PR**: Create pull request with clear description

## Build Commands

```bash
# Quick validation
cargo check
cargo test --lib

# Full pipeline (required before commit)
just pre-commit-all

# Development helpers
just watch                    # Auto-recompile on changes
cargo test --lib -- db::     # Run specific module tests
```

## Architecture Notes

### Partner-Centric Model
- **Partner**: Person receiving ADHD support (owns constellation)
- **Conversant**: Someone interacting through partner's agents
- **Privacy**: DM content never bleeds into public channels
- **Scaling**: Each partner gets full constellation, hibernated when inactive

### Backend API Server (In Development)
- Basic Axum server structure exists in `pattern_server`
- Handlers need implementation
- Required for multi-user hosting and non-technical users
- Will provide HTTP/WebSocket APIs, MCP integration, Discord bot hosting
